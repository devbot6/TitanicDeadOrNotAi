# Titanic Survival Prediction

This program predicts the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The model is based on the Random Forest algorithm, and it predicts whether a passenger survived based on features such as class, sex, fare, and age.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares the raw data by removing unnecessary columns and converting categorical variables (e.g., sex) into numeric labels.
- **Modeling**: Utilizes a Random Forest Classifier to train on historical data and predict the survival of passengers.
- **Evaluation**: The model's accuracy is evaluated on a validation dataset.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
